# Weather-App
React application that allows user to search for city and display weather forecast.

To run app:
1. git clone this repo
2. open app
3. cd weather-app
4. npm i
5. npm start


API_KEY is stored on .env file and not shared to this repo. If you want an API_KEY register at openweathermap. I suggest storing API_KEY in .env file so that the API_KEY cannot be found on repo.
